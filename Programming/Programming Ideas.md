# Programming Ideas

* Very simple Android "game" similar to [Probability Math Puzzles](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=atorch.statspuzzles&hl=en&gl=US), but with my own high-school-level problems.
  - could also be a web app
* Web app for interesting astronomical computations
  - Earth diameter computation based on sunset observations,
  - Moon distance based on lunar parallax (two moon photos in one night)
* Web app for deep neural image manipulation
* Special relativity playground (WIP)

## Data visualization and analysis

Create an article online with graphs, or just a fancy data visualization. Publish source code for graphs on GitHub. Interactive for extra points :)

 * Could be just a blog post [like this](https://b-reddy.org/height-impacts-strength/)
 * Graphs can be published on [/r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/). This is great for inspiration.

 Some ideas:

  * Height or strength in (professional) climbers. Indoors/outdoors, male/female, BMI.
  * Interactive orbital mechanics simulation. This is probably quite hard. Or a special/general relativity visualization. I can help with the maths.
  * Calculating Earth diameter by
