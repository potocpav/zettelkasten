# Scientific Mistakes

## Learning Styles

Learning styles are a stubborn myth. They were conjectured by an Australian guy, without supporting evidence. [Veritasium video](https://youtu.be/rhgwIhB58PA)

## Posilování mládeže

Názor od nějakého českého doktora z minulého století, založený na nepodložených úvahách.

## Weight Loss is not CICO

Consumed energy can be transformed into three things:

1. Body weight
2. Heat
3. Poop, urine, sweat, and other secretions

Human digestive tract is highly efficient, and the energy losses via secretions (3.) [are  less than 10%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atwater_system).

Heat (2.) is dependent on basal metabolism, exercise, and digestion. Basal metabolism [varies by ~25%](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/82/5/941/4607670) when accounted for lean body mass and fat mass. Within-subject effects are negligible (~2%), and the fasting effect is largely a myth. Digestive thermal effects are food-dependent, 10-15% of intake.

Therefore, body weight can be quite precisely manipulated by manipulating exercise and consumption. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) must be, however, accurately assessed for the individual. There are [simple formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) for that, but it is possible that an individual has significantly different BMR. This can be assessed by observing body mass over a period of time, and adjusting diet accordingly.
