This is a proposal for a beginner 3x3 cube solving method based on Roux.

All steps, apart from solving last layer corners (LLC), is based on [Kian Manssour's beginner Roux tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj_IsOCJS3k&list=PLBHocHmPzgIjnAbNLHDycgaCP5IqiwnU9).

Last layer corners are solved by a method inspired by [JPerm's 10 minute beginner method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ron6MN45LY).

The advantages of this method are:

* Low number of algorithms (sexy move & sledgehammer)
* Easy and gradual transition to Roux
* Intuitive L6E and L4E steps, which is fun to figure out while not being too daunting

# Method

## 1. First Block

1. First block is started by intuitively solving the RD edge (white-orange), and attaching it to the right center (orange).
2. Then, we find the orange-blue edge and put it into the FD position ("loading position") in any orientation.
3. Then, we find the orange-blue-white corner and put it in the top layer with the white sticker not on top.
4. We align the edge and corner from previous steps using U moves
5. With M moves, we connect them into a pair
6. With U moves, we put the edge + corner pair into the UF edge
7. we insert the pair with either U' or L' U L.
8. RB edge + corner is solved in an analogous way

## 2. Second Block

1. Second block is started by intuitively solving the LD edge (white-red)
2. We repeat the methods from first block to insert the last two pairs.

## 3. Permute Corners using sexy-sledgehammer
## 4. Orient corners using the beginner repeated-sexy method
## 5. Orient edges
## 6. Solve LU, RU edges
## 7. Solve 4E
