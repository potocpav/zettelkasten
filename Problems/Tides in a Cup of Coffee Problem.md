# Tides in a Cup of Coffee Problem

Lunar gravity causes water level in cups to be slightly angled. What is the maximum angle? What is the maximum height difference ("tide") at the edges?

## Solution

[wolfram alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=+100+mm+*+%28moon+weight+%2F+moon+distance+from+earth+%5E+2%29+%2F+%28earth+weight+%2F+earth+radius%5E2%29)

Maximum tide will occur with the moon being on the horizon. It will be on the order of 1 Î¼m, depending on the cup size.
