You drank all juice from a carton. But some juice, say 1 ml, is still stuck to the carton walls. You need to wash it out so the carton doesn't get smelly too soon. To do that, you would wash it using a procedure like this:

1. Pour in some clean water,
2. Shake the carton to equalize juice concentration,
3. Pour the liquid out.

But no matter what you do, 1 ml of liquid always remains inside after step 3. Therefore, you may need to repeat the washing procedure above several times to remove as much juice as possible.

**Question 1:** You use 100 ml of water to wash out the container once according to the procedure above. How much juice (approx.) still remains in the container?

**Question 2:** You use 100 ml of water, but you wash out the container twice: each time using 50 ml. How much juice (approx.) still remains in the container?

**Question 3:** Is the 50/50 split for two washes ideal, or is it more efficient to split the 100 ml in a different way? We want to remove as much juice as possible.

**Question 4:** We still have 100 ml of clean water in total, but we can now repeat the washing procedure as many times as we want. What is the ideal number of washes? Using this number, how much juice would remain in the carton in the end?
